Starting on smart contracts
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
Smart Contracts - A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss.

// Define the compiler version you would be using
 ----pragma solidity ^0.8.10;

// Start by creating a contract named HelloWorld
-----contract HelloWorld {
